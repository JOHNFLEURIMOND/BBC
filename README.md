# My Awesome BBC Project
I created a BBC Website to practice my HTML, CSS skills when I first started up!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS.
This was the very beginning of me starting to learn the HTML & CSS Langauge 

## Optimizations
I would love to go back and fix the styling of the whole website. The knowledge I had then I am surprised that it even came out ok but I see alot I can do better. This was a third of the website, I would make it a full site that had href links to the other pages of the site.


I would had a "ahh haa!' moment when I first found out about float left.
